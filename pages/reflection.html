    <h1>Piece of Mind:<h1>
    <p>Welcome to The Feel Good Project! During the course of the Covid-19 Quarantine I created one feel good a day to spread to my loved ones and the community. This has been executed through intimate phone chats with friends to the scale of tangible items spread through out my home town. </p>
    <p>Everyday of the Quaratine I began to do something to help my friends, family, and hometown know that they are not alone. This project was very eye opening for me to recieve such appreciation for such small acts. Of course these fun tasks did not go with out their own hiccups, like how the cake I made for my grand parents didn't perfectly come out of the pan, or how some of my posters had some small spelling errors, but the silver lining of this project was that my small errors that I would have beat myself up over if I was at school being graded no longer mattered. The purpose of this project wasn't to make the best design or have the best research but it was to help those I truly cared about and that is something so priceless no other project can compare.</p>
